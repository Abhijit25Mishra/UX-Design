### Identifying the difference between user and end user
In the field of user experience design, one of the most important terms is "user." A user is any person who uses a product. In addition, the end user is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for. Our goal as UX designers is to think about problems and needs from the end user's perspective and design an experience to meet those needs. 

- User: Any one who uses the product
- End-User: The specific audience a UX designer creates something for.
- User experience: How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product. (usually focused on the end-user).

#### why user centered design 
Because the user buys and uses your product. In addition, it's also important to solve problems that people actually experience, rather than only trying to solve problems you personally experience. Focusing on real user problems reduces the impact of designer bias. 

ere are the key steps in the user-centered design process: 

-   **Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.** You want to know how users will engage with your design, as well as the environment or context in which they’ll experience the product. Understanding this requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews, which we’ll explore more later.
    
-   **Specify the user’s needs.** Based on your research, figure out which user problems are the most important to solve. 
    
-   **Design solutions to those user problems.** Come up with lots of ideas for designs that can address the user problems you’ve identified. Then, start to actually design those ideas! 
    
-   **Evaluate the solutions you designed against the user’s needs.** Ask yourself, “Does the design I created solve the user’s problem?” To answer this question, you should test the product you designed with real people and collect feedback.

Arrows show progression in order, but they also circle back.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pN87KCz0QOKfOygs9NDipg_2d2a3bb220c54a6bae8bb16a0c175912_UX_C1_M2_L2_R1_A.png?expiry=1646179200000&hmac=p7nvIR7q2cAcTcGmnXTF3yRHJXgYcxqeUk5rb26WLNc)

Notice how the arrows in the diagram indicate circular movement. This illustrates the iterative quality of the user-centered design process. Designers go back to earlier phases of the process to refine and make corrections to their designs. With the user-centered design process, you’re always working to improve the user’s experience and address the problems that users are facing!
