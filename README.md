# Learn UX design 

Start reading with [[General Info]]. That will provide you details on how I list my files and the naming structure. then start of learning from [[1.1.1]]. 

My recommendation is to clone this repo locally and use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view and edit the files to your liking.

Most of what I have written on shared here is available for free, provided by Google on Coursera.
