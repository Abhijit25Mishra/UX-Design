# Design across platform

Read [[1.2.2]] before this.

A platform is the medium that users experience your product on, such as desktop, mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, wearables, TVs, smart displays, and more. It's important to design with multiple platforms in mind, because users want a product to look and feel similar, no matter what platform they're using.
it's important to focus on one platform first when you build a new product. The platform you select should be the one that best meets your end users' needs. Later, you can design for additional platforms. In addition to having a consistent user experience across platforms, it's also important to have a consistent brand identity.
