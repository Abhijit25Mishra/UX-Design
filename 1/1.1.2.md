# 1.1.2 Job Responsibility in UX
read [[1.1.1]] before this

Entry-level UX designers start their careers by doing a lot of tasks to learn the basics.
- **Reseaching**: UX designers use research to understand audiences and learn about their backgrounds; demographics, like age and location; motivations; pain points; emotions; and life goals.
- **Wireframing**: A wireframe is an outline or a sketch of a product or a screen. It helps the designer figure out how a page is arranged, where each piece of a product fits in with the others, and how users will likely interact with the product. Wireframing is one of the first steps designers take when building a new product or feature. It's done after or at the same time as the research. These wireframes were designed to demonstrate the basic structure of the page to gain support from key stakeholders, people with a business interest in the final product.
- **Prototyping**: A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality, like a wireframe, but a lot more advanced. While a wireframe gives you a general idea of where things go and how the product will function, a prototype illustrates a progression from one screen to the next.
- **Creating information architecture**: It is the framework of a website, or how it's organized, categorized, and structured.
- **Communicating effectively**: like meetings with colleagues, writing emails, creating proposals, or pitching clients.

## Specialist and generalist designers

As you get further along in your career, you can choose to specialize in a certain area of UX design or keep your skill set more broad. What exactly are the differences between specialist and generalist UX designers? Read on to learn more!

**Specialist**: A specialist dives deep into one type of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design, and becomes an expert. Specialist UX designers are more common at large companies that have a lot of designers, like here at Google. Some of the benefits of becoming a specialist include:

-   Focusing on one type of design that you enjoy more than others.
    
-   Gaining deep knowledge of one type of design.
    
-   Becoming well-known in the industry for your expertise in a particular type of design.
    

**Generalist**: A generalist has a broad number of responsibilities. A majority of UX design jobs are generalist positions, especially at companies with fewer UX designers. Typically, entry-level UX designers work in generalist roles, and some people choose to stay in generalist design roles for their entire careers. There are a lot of benefits to being a generalist UX designer, like: 

-   Expanding your skills in many different types of UX work.
    
-   Trying a variety of responsibilities and finding an area of UX that you’re especially passionate about. 
    
-   Keeping your job feeling fresh and new, while doing a variety of tasks.
    

**T-shaped**: A T-shaped designer is a specialist who also has a lot of capabilities in other areas. T-shaped designers get their name because the stem (or vertical line) of a T represents their expertise in one area, while the top (or horizontal line) symbolizes their related skills in a broad number of areas. T-shaped designers are great to have on your team, since they come with the benefits of both specialists and generalists. The image below highlights some of the skills a T-shaped UX designer might have. In this example, the person is a visual design specialist but also has knowledge in other areas, like coding and prototyping.

Each designer tends to naturally have a little T-shape in their abilities, even at the beginning of their career. As you start to work on projects, you’ll probably notice where your strengths and interests lie. As you get better at one area of design, you’ll likely find yourself working on that part of design projects more often, which helps you continue to improve in one area.

You can also decide to direct your T-shape by developing specific skills that will open up future job opportunities. For example, you might work extra hard on your prototyping skills, in addition to your general UX design skills, which can lead to new experiences and professional growth.
