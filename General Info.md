# General Info
**These are the notes of Abhijit Mishra** 

### Reason to learn UI/UX design 
- Felt like it 

### File Naming Pattern
Following the course :[Googles certification course]( https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design#howItWorks)
well I wont be getting any certificate without paying but definitely can learn something.

It is a series of 7 courses, each course 4 week long (expected time division), each week has divided its content into 3-6 sections.

so, file 3.1.2 -> indicates 3rd course 1st week 2nd section.

I might have a lot of cross over so I will try to add internal links as much as I can so it all stay connected. (use obsidian for reading, provides great features for free.)

### Updates
- added a new line of files called essentials, which I feel are very relevant not just as a designer but in any job. These will be a must read weather your learning UX or not. I high recommend to go through these and leverage this knowledge to your advantage.
